# Excel-Hospital-Emergency-Room-Project

# Project Purpose

The goal of this project was to design and develop a Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard in Excel. The dashboard provides hospital management and stakeholders with real-time, actionable insights into ER operations, helping them monitor patient flow, improve service quality, and optimize resources.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

** The dashboard was designed to track the following:

1.Patient Admission Status – Breakdown of admitted vs. not admitted patients.

2.Age Distribution – Grouping patients into defined age ranges (0–4, 5–14, 15–29, 30–44, 45–59, 60–69, 70–79).

3.Timeliness of Care – Percentage of patients attended within 30 minutes vs. delayed.

4.Gender Analysis – Patient count by gender for demographic insights.

5.Department Referrals – Identifying which departments received the highest ER referrals.

# Key Findings from Dashboard

1.Admissions: Roughly half of the patients were admitted, showing a balanced triage and admission system.

2.Wait Times: Around 62% of patients were seen within 30 minutes, while 38% experienced delays, directly impacting satisfaction scores.

3.Age Profile: Most patients fell between 30–69 years old, highlighting higher ER usage among working-age and older adults.

4.Gender Split: Female patients slightly outnumber male patients, reflecting trends in healthcare-seeking behavior.

5.Top Referrals: General Practice and Orthopedics received the highest referrals, while specialized referrals (Neurology, Renal) were rare but critical.

# Methodology

. Data Modeling: Built using calendar tables and calculated fields in DAX (e.g., Age Grouping, Attend Status).

# Formulas Used:

. Age Grouping: Classified patients into meaningful age brackets.

. Attend Status: Categorized patients as “Within Time” or “Delayed” based on a 30-minute threshold.

. Visualization: Created a comprehensive dashboard showing admissions, demographics, timeliness, gender breakdown, and department referrals.

. Strategic Insights & Recommendations

. Reduce Delays: Focus on patients experiencing delays by optimizing staff allocation during peak hours.

. Improve Satisfaction: Since satisfaction correlates with wait times, better queue management and patient communication could raise scores.

. Department Support: Allocate more resources to General Practice & Orthopedics since they handle the largest referral load.

. Ongoing Monitoring: Use the dashboard for monthly/quarterly tracking to anticipate demand surges and adjust staffing proactively.

# Conclusion

This end-to-end dashboard project demonstrates how data-driven decision-making can transform hospital emergency room management. By visualizing patient flow, admission trends, and service efficiency, the hospital gains a powerful tool to:

Improve patient experience,

Reduce operational bottlenecks, and

Optimize healthcare delivery.

The project provides a scalable foundation for expanding analytics into other hospital departments in the future.
